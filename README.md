This is an instruction to run the above code.

#### Step 1: Initiate a database

Among the folder provided, one of them is “SQL files”. This includes all the SQL files that you will need to create your database. 

To create this database, along with all the table and stored procedures, start your MySQL Workbench. 

Next, sign in into your localhost instance (or any other instances). 

Open all the SQL files above.

Next, execute the SQL files, starting from 1 -> 13. That is, first execute “1. createDatabaseAndUserTable”, then “2. createBlogDatabase”, and so on. You’ll have a database ready to go.

#### Step 2: Change your app.py file

So the app.py file is primary file which we will run. You will have to fill out your mySQL password in order for it to run.

If you’re not using localhost, then change that variable as well.

Get the client_secret.json file from Google Oauth

Get FB Client ID and FB Client Secret. Add these variables into a file called credentials.py
